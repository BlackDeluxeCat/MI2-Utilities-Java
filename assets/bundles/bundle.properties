fullAI.help = Logic Custom AI can control player unit with processor code. After learning the basics of logic, you need to understand several changes that this AI makes to regular logic: \
  \n\n[accent]@unit[] Permanently automatically bind player units, cannot be changed. So [accent]Ucontrol, Ulocate, etc.[], can be used directly.\
  \n\nPlayer actions are divided into two parts: move, attack, and two timers are independent. 10s without control or using [accent]idle|stop[] will release the control to other AIs.\
  \n\nLogic is based on world processor and can use world-sense instructions, but world-modifying and unsimulable instructions only work in single-player sandbox, such as [accent]SetProp, Write, SetBlock, etc.[] \
  \n\nSome logic functions are implemented by simulating players, such as [accent]Control-config[].\
  \n\nMultiple custom logics can be stored, but only one can be run at a time.\
  \n\nOn first load, a default logic with sandbox map editor will be loaded.\
  \n\nYou can customize the UI using Print statements. The statements for creating controls are as follows:\
  \n[accent]UI.row()[]\
  \nStarts a new row in the UI pane.\
  \n[accent]UI.clear()[]\
  \nClean all children in UI pane.\
  \n[accent]UI.button(variable name)[]\
  \nGenerates a button that sets boolean variable.\
  \n[accent]UI.field(variable name)[]\
  \nGenerates a text box that sets numeric variable.\
  \n[accent]UI.choose(variable name)[]\
  \nGenerates a selection box that sets variable to an item, unit, building, or other type. The variable needs to be initialized to a quantity of that type.\
  \n[accent]UI.info(variable name)[]\
  \nGenerates a label and monitors the variable.\
  \nSimply write the statement (in double quotes) in the Print statement. \
  \nEach time the statement is executed, a new control is generated, so please place it in the initialization statement.\
  \n\nThe Developer shall not be liable for any consequences arising from the improper use of this feature.
